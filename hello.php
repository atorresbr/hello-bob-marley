	Well, alright
	We're jammin'
	Sing it, I want to jam it with you
	We're jammin', we're jammin'
	And I hope you like jammin' too
	Ain't no rules, ain't no vow
	You can do it anyhow
	'Cause I and I will see you through
	But every day we pay the price
	Come a little sacrifice
	Jammin' 'til the jam is through
	Ooh yeah, we're jammin', hey
	To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
	We're jammin', we're jammin'
	And I hope this jam is gonna last
	No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
	Neither can be bought nor sold
	We all defend the right, Jah-Jah children must unite
	'Cause life is worth much more than gold
	Ooh yeah, we're jammin'
	And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord
	We're jammin', we're jammin'
	And we're jammin' right straight from yard
	Ay
